These are the downloadable code samples for Pro ASP.NET MVC 2 Framework by Steven Sanderson [Apress, 2010].
(c) Steven Sanderson 2010

Notes:

* These code samples represent each of the major tutorials and large blocks of code found throughout the book.
  The purpose of this is to save you the trouble of typing in lengthy code samples if you find useful classes
  and helper methods you want to use in your own projects. However, this download does *not* include every single 
  code listing from the entire book, as there are hundreds of small code snippets that only serve to illustrate 
  points being made in the book, and you can quickly type these in by hand if you want.

* Code samples are arranged by chapter to match the book

* For the major examples in Chapter 2 (PartyInvites) and Chapters 4-6 (SportsStore), I've provided both
  Visual Studio 2008 (.NET 3.5) and Visual Studio 2010 (.NET 4) versions of the code. This is to help
  .NET 3.5 readers who may be unsure how to convert the <%: ... %> syntax to .NET 3.5-compatible code.

* For all other examples, I've provided only Visual Studio 2010 (.NET 4) code. If you don't have Visual Studio
  2010, you can download the free Visual Web Developer 2010 Express from http://www.microsoft.com/express/downloads/.
  This includes ASP.NET MVC 2.

Have fun!
