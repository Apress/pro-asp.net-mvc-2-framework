            Things to note here:
            * The generated assembly reference the Castle.MonoRail.MonoRailBrail and Castle.MonoRail.Framework assemblies
            * If a common scripts assembly exist, it is also referenced
            * The AddBrailBaseClassStep compiler step is added - to create a class from the view's code
            * The ProcessMethodBodiesWithDuckTyping is replaced with ReplaceUknownWithParameters
              this allows to use naked parameters such as (output context.IsLocal) without using 
              any special syntax
            * The FixTryGetParameterConditionalChecks is run afterward, to transform "if ?Error" to "if not ?Error isa IgnoreNull"
            * The ExpandDuckTypedExpressions is replace with a derived step that allows the use of Dynamic Proxy assemblies
            * The IntroduceGlobalNamespaces step is removed, to allow to use common variables such as 
              date and list without accidently using the Boo.Lang.BuiltIn versions

            This is here because we need to overcome a tendecy of Dynamic Proxy to generate virtual override that
            do not match exactly what the compiler does.
            This means that when you do GetMethod("Foo") and DP has proxied it, you would get an exception because it would
            recognize two methods with this name.
            We recognize when we are trying to invoke something that DP has build and act accordingly.
            
            The code is mostly taken fro Boo.Lang.Runtime.RuntimeServices, and modified to understand that when the type is from DP, is should
            use DeclareOnly
